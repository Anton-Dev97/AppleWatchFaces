## TODO:
- fix warnings in IB 
- fix warnings in logs
- add color for minute hand ( and subclass color picker controller )
- add shapes / textures for backgrounds ( so we can have things like vinyl record )
- save / load current setting on watch
- save load list of watch faces
- switch to SVG files for shapes : https://github.com/mchoe/SwiftSVG or https://github.com/pocketsvg/PocketSVG

## IDEAS:
- show name of current face on watch when first starting ( then fade it out )
- better highlighting of the parts ( zoomed in outline )

## COMPLETED
- switch to sending JSONData for watch comms
- add color picker
